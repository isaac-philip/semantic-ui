Direct utilization of Semantic-UI in projects using snippets/code from this repo.

Example ui with form/ calendar themes etc

All examples are derived from the original website for Semantic UI - https://semantic-ui.com

Semantic UI, IMO, is the best UI Development framework.
For many years I used bootstrap until a year back i.e. around Q4 2017 when I wanted to look at an alternative
and really liked Semantic UI with the eye candy rendering.


#### Important files needed in every page for rendering Semantic-UI components.
    1. css - semantic.css
    2. js -  semantic.js
          - jquery.js


Examples are,
    1. [Form basic](form/form.html)
    2. [Dropdown](form/dropdown.html)
    3. [Dropdown with Autocomplete](form/dropdown-autocomplete.html)
